  Raindrop Catcher consists of rain falling from the top of the screen towards the bottom. Near the bottom is a Catcher, which is controlled by the user. The user can laterally move the catcher using the mouse, and can move it slightly up and down.  Blue and green rain fall from the sky equally.  For every blue drop caught, the score increases by 1.  For each green drop caught, the score increases by 5.  A limited number golden raindrops fall.  Each one caught is worth 20 points.  As the player earns more points, the status bar at the top of the screen changes.  Additionally, there are a few red raindrops.  When these are caught, the game ends immediately. The game ends after 32 seconds after it is opened, regardless of when the screen is clicked to start.  
    The game has various bugs.  While the game begins as the user clicks the mouse, it often takes more than one click to get the gameplay started.  The player should keep clicking until the game starts because the timer runs independent of gameplay.  Also, the game does not display the intended end screen, but still shows a suitable end screen with the score.
