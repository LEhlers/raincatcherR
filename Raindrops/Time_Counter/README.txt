The raindrop game consists of rain falling from the top of the screen towards the bottom. Near the bottom is a Catcher, which is controlled by the user. As raindrops touch the catcher, the score increases by one point for each raindrop caught. However, after a certain number of raindrops hit the ground and are not caught the game ends. During the game, there are single raindrops of the colors green, red, purple, and gold. If caught, these raindrops are worth 2, 5, 10, and 20 points respectively.
